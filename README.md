### Why is it named framework instead of engine? ###
A framework is providing you tools, but it is not forcing you to use all of them. You may find some of these classed too simple.

### Does it have some examples? ###
Yes. And there will be more.

### What's the licence? ###
Libpng/zlib licence. Do what you want (even compile staticly). If you redistrubute the source don't remove information about authors.

### How to build ###
`cd ugf-master
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DCMAKE_SHARED=ON ..
make`
-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON and -DCMAKE_SHARED=ON are optional
if you have your libraries in non-default location use
`-DCMAKE_LIBRARY ... =/my/location`
if you want to install UGF in specific location use
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/location`
